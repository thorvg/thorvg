# Usage
### With HTML (Basic Usage)

Once you import from CDN, you can access `<lottie-player/>`

```html
<lottie-player 
  autoPlay 
  loop
  mode="normal"
  src="https://lottie.host/6d7dd6e2-ab92-4e98-826a-2f8430768886/NGnHQ6brWA.json"
  style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"
>
</lottie-player>
```

### With NPM (JS/TS)

Import the library and please follow Basic Usage, you can use library on any NPM-based project such as React, Vue and Svelte.

```ts
import '@thorvg/lottie-player';
```

### With ReactJS + TypeScript

Add `declarations.d.ts` on the root of project and make sure following declaration.

```js
declare namespace JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    "lottie-player": any;
  }
}
```

Then you will be able to use this as same as above
```js
import '@thorvg/lottie-player';

<lottie-player 
  autoPlay 
  loop
  mode="normal"
  src="https://lottie.host/6d7dd6e2-ab92-4e98-826a-2f8430768886/NGnHQ6brWA.json"
  style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"
>
</lottie-player>
```

### With SSR Framework
We should be careful when using on SSR frameworks such as NextJS, NuxtJS and Svelte, as it means the library must to be rendered on browser/client side.

- NextJS
```ts
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    import("@thorvg/lottie-player");
  });

  // ...
}
```

- NuxtJS
```html
<template>
  {/* ... */}
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    mounted() {
      import("@thorvg/lottie-player");
    }
  }
</script>
```

- Svelte
```html
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  onMount(async () => {
    await import('@thorvg/lottie-player');
  });
</script>
```

# API
## Properties

| Property | Description | Type | Default Value | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| src | A graphic resource to play. It could be an internal/external URL or JSON string for Lottie. | string | undefined | Y |
| speed | Animation speed (for Lottie) | number | 1 | N |
| autoplay | When set to true, automatically plays the animation on loading it (for Lottie) | boolean | false | N |
| count | Number of times to loop the animation | number | undefined | N |
| loop | When set to true, loops the animation. The count property defines the number of times to loop the animation. Setting the count property to 0 and setting the loop to true, loops the animation indefinitely. | boolean | false | N |
| direction | Direction of the animation. Set to 1 to play the animation forward or set to -1 to play it backward. | number (1 or -1) | 1 | N |
| mode | Play mode. Setting the mode to PlayMode.Bounce plays the animation in an indefinite cycle, forwards and then backwards. | PlayMode | PlayMode.Normal | N |
| intermission | Duration (in milliseconds) to pause before playing each cycle in a looped animation. Set this parameter to 0 (no pause) or any positive number. | number | 1 | N |

## Events
