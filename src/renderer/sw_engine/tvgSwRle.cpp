 * Introduction
 * ============

 * The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 * some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 * various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 * FreeType Project.

 * This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 * which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 * affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 * documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

 * This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 * (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 * and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 * alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

 *   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
 *     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

 *   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
 *      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

 *    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
 *      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
 *     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
 *     FreeType code. (`credits')

 * We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 * software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 * We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 * assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


 *  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
 *  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
 * encourage you to use the following text:

 *   """
 *    Portions of this software are copyright � <year> The FreeType
 *    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
 *   """

 *  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
 *  actually use.

* Legal Terms
* ===========

* 0. Definitions
* --------------

*   Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
*   and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
*   distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
*   Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
*   beta or final release.

*   `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
*   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
*   code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
*   This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
*   engine'.

*   This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
*   FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
*   documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
*   original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
*   If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
*   this license, you must contact us to verify this.

*   The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
*   Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
*   specified below.

*   forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to

*    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
*      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
*      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
*      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
*      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

*  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on

* 3. Advertising
* --------------

*  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use

*  purposes without specific prior written permission.

*  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
*  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
*  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
*  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

*  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
*  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
*  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
*  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
*  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
*  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
*  of this license.

* 4. Contacts
* -----------

*  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

*    o freetype@nongnu.org

*      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
*      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
*      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
*      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

*    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

*      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
*      specific licenses, porting, etc.
